# What is DNS ?

DNS stands for Domain Name System. It’s like the internet’s phonebook that translates human-friendly domain names (like google.com) into IP addresses (like 172.217.0.46) which computers use to communicate.

Without DNS, we would have to remember and type IP addresses to visit websites, which is not practical.
